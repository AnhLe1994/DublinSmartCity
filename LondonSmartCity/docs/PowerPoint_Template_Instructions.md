## Technical Requirements
1. Ensure all videos are embedded in the presentation

3. Have a backup copy (USB drive and cloud)
4. Check projector resolution beforehand

## Presentation Flow
1. Introduction (who you are, what you built)
2. Overview (what problem you're solving)
3. Technical deep dive (how you built it)
4. Demo (show it working)
5. Challenges and lessons (what you learned)
6. Conclusion (why it matters)
7. Q&A

## Slide Transitions
- Use simple, professional transitions
- Avoid excessive animation
